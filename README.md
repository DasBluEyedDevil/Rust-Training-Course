## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Don't skip Module 0** - Proper setup prevents frustration
2. **Use rust-analyzer** - It catches errors as you type
3. **Read compiler errors carefully** - They're surprisingly helpful
4. **Don't rush Module 4** - Ownership is THE hardest but most important concept
5. **Type every example** - Don't copy-paste; muscle memory matters
6. **Build all practice projects** - They synthesize concepts
7. **Join the community** - Ask questions on forums/Discord
8. **Be patient** - Fighting the borrow checker is normal for beginners
9. **Use the outlines** - Modules 6-11 outlines can guide self-study

## 📝 Course Development Status
